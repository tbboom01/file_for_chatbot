Cos'è LoL?;League of Legends (often referred as LOL) is the most popular video game in the world. With more than 8 million active players a day, LOL has one of the most established professional esports leagues in the world. League of Legends is what those in the gaming world would call a multiplayer battle arena (MOBA) video game. Which means that players must work together as a team to achieve specific objects and goals to ultimately defeat the opposing team.
Come si gioca?;Each team assigns their players to different areas of Summoner’s Rift, the most commonly used map in League of Legends to face off against an opponent and attempt to gain control for their team. Each team is comprised of 5 players in the match. Each player is given one of 5 roles: Top, Jungle, Mid, ADC and Support. As the game progresses, players complete a variety of tasks, including collecting computer-controlled minions, removing turrets (which protect each team’s side of the map respectively), and eliminating champions (player-controlled characters).
Come capisco chi vince su lol?;There are a couple things you can look at. Between champions that are laning against each other, the one with a higher level or more minions killed is usually ahead. Total team gold and towers taken, both of which are displayed in the spectator overlay, are usually good indicators to tell which team is ahead.
Quali sono gli obiettivi su lol?;Turrets, Inibithors, Dragons, Baron Nashor and Rift Herald.

Come funziona la seconda fase del mondiale? (Sistema svizzero);"A Swiss-system tournament is a non-eliminating tournament format that features a fixed number of rounds of competition, but considerably fewer than for a round-robin tournament; thus each competitor (team or individual) does not play all the other competitors. Competitors meet one-on-one in each round and are paired using a set of rules designed to ensure that each competitor plays opponents with a similar running score, but does not play the same opponent more than once. The winner is the competitor with the highest aggregate points earned in all rounds. With an even number of participants, all competitors play in each round."
